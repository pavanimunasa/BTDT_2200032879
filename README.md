Electricity Bill Calculator DApp
This project is a simple Decentralized Application (DApp) for calculating electricity bills using Solidity, Ganache, 
MetaMask, and a user-friendly interface. The application collects electricity meter readings, calculates energy consumption,
and generates the corresponding bill. It is designed to run locally using Ganache for blockchain simulation and integrates 
MetaMask for user authentication and transaction signing.
